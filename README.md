# HW4

This assignment focuses on methods of classification when data has a class imbalance. You will compare results obtained with Synthetic Minority Oversampling, ADASYN with FastKDE, and Normalizing Flows to oversample the minority class. To develop the data application, you will use

This dataset is very large, and in this project, you may subset 10% of observations from each class. Your results should include confusion matrices and stratified K-fold validated estimates of accuracy and recalls.

For the overall presentation format of the project, the following is a good example:
